# Code files for BayesCausalFactor

### General functions (in **`src`** folder):
- all files called **`*causal*.R`**:

   Gibbs for our model: each file has a different variation
- **`bart_bcf.R`**:
   
    code for competitor: bart (bcf da sistemare), with indipendence between variables
- **`linear model.R`**:
   
    code for competitor: linear model, with indipendence between variables
- **`code _parallelized.R`**:
   
    function to parallelize the code for replicated (useful for simulation study)

  ### Simulation studys:
 - **`boh`** file:
